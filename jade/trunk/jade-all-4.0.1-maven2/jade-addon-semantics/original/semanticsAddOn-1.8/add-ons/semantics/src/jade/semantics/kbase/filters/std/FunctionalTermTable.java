/**
 * @author Thierry Martinez
 * This kind of table aims at storing functional terms, so that they can be queried
 * with special implicit predicates. 
 * Functional terms that can be stored in this table must be instances of
 * FunctionalTermParamNode, which means they have 
 * the following form (name :param1 value1 :param2 value2 :param3 value3 ...).
 * To issue query about this fact, the implicit predicates to use look like
 * (name:param1&param2&param3 gid value1 value2 value3) where
 * gid is a global identifier, value1 to value3 can be both a constant or a variable.
 * 
 * To use such a table, one just has to create a table instance as
 * a field member of his agent class, then to retrieve and add the associated
 * query filter to the agent's knowledge base, as shown in the example hereunder :
 * 
 * public class MyAgent extends SemanticAgent {
 *
 *	FunctionalTermTable storage;
 *	
 *	class MainSemanticCapabilities extends DefaultCapabilities {
 *		protected KBase setupKbase() {
 *			FilterKBase kb = (FilterKBase) super.setupKbase();		
 *			storage = new FunctionalTermTableImpl(kb);						
 *			return kb;
 *		}
 *	}
 *	
 *	public Main() {
 *		semanticCapabilities = new MainSemanticCapabilities();
 *	}
 *	
 *	public void setup() {
 *		super.setup();
 *		storage.load((String)getArguments()[0]);
 *	}
 *}

				<p>
					jade4spring was started as an in-house project for
					easily creating JADE
					agents and containers through
					Spring application contexts.
				</p>
				<p>
					The project was started by developers at
					<a href="http://www.integrasco.com">
						Integrasco A/S
					</a>
					and in February 2008 we decided that it was now time
					to release it to the
					open source community.

/**
 * Provides the classes used by the JSA engine to parse and unparse FIPA-SL
 * expressions.
 * 
 * The format of parsed expressions relies on the hierarchy of
 * {@link jade.semantics.lang.sl.grammar.Node} classes (see the
 * {@link jade.semantics.lang.sl.grammar} package). Note that this hierarchy
 * actually implements an extension of FIPA-SL, which includes meta-references
 * and makes it possible to match and instantiate patterns of expressions
 * against regular expressions (see the {@link jade.semantics.lang.sl.tools.SL}
 * class).

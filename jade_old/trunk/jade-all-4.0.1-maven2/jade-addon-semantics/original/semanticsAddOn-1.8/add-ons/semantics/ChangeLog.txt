MAJOR CHANGES in JSA 1.8 (18 February 2009)
==========================================================================


- Extensions:
              added the 'institutions' extensions, which makes it possible to
              reason about institutional facts (obligations, institutional
              powers...) and semantically interpret institutional speech acts
              (declarations, promises).

- General packaging:
              refactored the build.xml file to improve the build process. The
              'j2se' and 'pjava' targets now only build the JSA kernel (without
              any demo nor JSA extension). Each JSA extension has its own target
              and creates an independent jar file. Also, each demo can be
              directly compiled and run with ant (see 'ant help' for details).






MAJOR CHANGES in JSA 1.6 (6 May 2008)
==========================================================================


- Belief Base: 
             * added the handling of "built-in" predicates, with a simple
               Java API to code their query evaluation and assertion. The
               default belief base now includes the handling of useful
               predicates such as member, nth, card, +, -, * ,/, ...
             * modified the queryRef method, so that it returns a Term instead
               of a ListOfTerm. Consequently, the queryRef on a iota or any
               IRE returns directly the term representing the queried object,
               whereas a queryRef on a some or all IRE returns an SL set of
               all queried objects
             * added a parameter to the query and queryRef methods to return
               a list of true formula, which explain why the query is
               false (this parameter is useless if the query returns a
               result). This is particularly useful to compute the reason
               of a FAILURE act for example
             * added a timeout mechanism on the observers (just like on
               application-specific SIPs)
             * better reorganised the jade.semantics.kbase package
               
- Handling of FIPA-SL expressions:
             * the SL parser now shares the same Node instance for all the
               occurrences of the same meta-reference within an expression,
               which fixes some bugs and improves performances of related
               algorithms, such as the matching algorithm.
             * optimized the creation of SL Nodes (using a hashed symbol table)
               and added the necessary static methods in the SL class to create
               SL constants accordingly (symbol, string, word, date, bytes,
               integer, real). The fromFormula and fromTerm methods have also
               been renamed into formula and term
             * added a FactNode, which makes it possible to reify SL formulas
               into terms. The corresponding SL syntax is (fact <formula>)
             * added a ContentNode structure to represent the content of
               communicative acts. The corresponding SL syntax is (content
               <contentExpr1> <contentExpr2> ...). Together with the FactNode,
               this is particularly useful to directly match communicative
               acts with a pattern of propositional content
               
- Semantic Interpretation Principles:
             * the intention transfer- and planning-related SIPs has been
               improved, so that the plan finally selected for performance
               is interpreted by a new formula of the form
               (is_doing <agent> <plan>)
               and may be catched by application-specific SIPs for
               modification of update before actual performance
               
- Semantic Capabilities:
             * a new method interpretAfterPlan(Plan,FormulaSuccess,FormulaFailure)
               have been added to interpret a formula depending of the
               success of a plan to perform. In particular, it is very useful
               to delay the effect of a SIP (e.g. to decide whether to adopt
               a belief depending on the answer of another agent).
               
- Semantic Actions:
             * added some useful actions: test, interpret, wait

- Extensions:
             * added the jade.semantics.ext package to include some extensions
               to the JSA framework
             * included the emotion extension, which handles an emotional
               state for JSA-based agents. This may be useful to implement
               "intelligent" user interface agents. See the package-info.java
               file to test it.
             * included the sqlwrapper extension, which connects a JSA belief
               base with a SQL database. In particular, it makes it possible:
                 - to store some patterns of beliefs in a relational database
                   (and retrieve them in the other way). This is particularly
                   useful to share some beliefs with other agents or to save
                   them in a persistent maner.
                 - to get some beliefs from existing SQL tables. This is
                   particularly useful to interface a JSA agent with a legacy
                   system.
               See the package-info.java file to test it.

- Other: fixed numerous bugs, and updated the JSA tutorial (in the
               doc/tutorials/english directory), which can be used as the
               reference programming guide.
               Note also that the compliance with the .NET and the pJava
               environments has not been checked.






MAJOR CHANGES in JSA 1.4 (30 April 2007)
==========================================================================


REFACTORED DESIGN OF SOME JSA INTERNALS
- Belief Base
  * The default implementation of the KBase interface has been better structured
    and split into ArrayListKBaseImpl and FilterKBaseImpl. The latter class can
    now wrap any instance of KBase (including a nested FilterKBaseImpl).
  * The mechanism of observer has been clearly separated from the KBase
    implementation itself.
  * The methods to handle closed predicates have been moved to the KBase
    interface.
  * As for query filters, the QueryResult class has been improved with methods
    to set more easily individual or a set of results to a query. As for
    assertion filters, the doApply method of the KBAssertFilterAdapter class has
    been improved to support recursive applications of filters.
  * The filters to handle the memory of past events have been gathered into the
    single EventMemoryFilters class (extending the FiltersDefinition one).
- Semantic Actions
  * The hierarchy of classes implementing the performance of actions (under the
    SemanticBehaviourBase class) has been improved to factor some duplicate
    code.
- FIPA-SL expressions handling
  * For the sake of readibility, the SLPatternManip class (to handle FIPA-SL
    expressions) has been renamed into SL
- Demos
  * The demo package has been reorganised (now named jsademos) and enriched with
    the new booktrading demo, which is described in the just published book on
    JADE by Wiley.
- Semantic Interpretation Principles
  * Every table used by the JSA engine is now initialized by an explicit
    separate loader (the DefaultSemanticInterpretationPrincipleLoader class
    loads the SemanticInterpretationPrincipleTableImpl class, the
    DefaultSemanticActionLoader class loads the SemanticActionTableImpl class
    and the DefaultFilterKBaseLoader class loads the FilterKBaseImpl class).
  * The SIP table has been redesigned and is now accessed through SIP classes,
    each SIP being associated to a given class. In this way, it becomes more
    intuitive to add new SIPs in the table at the proper place, only depending
    on its class.


SIMPLIFIED PROGRAMMING STYLE
- Progressive deprecation of the StandardCustomization class, each of its
  methods to override being replaced with one or more instances of a proper SIP
  adapter to add to the SIP table (see the list of SIP adapters below).
  Removed the Planner interface (and the planner package), which is similarly
  replaced with one or more instances of the PlanningSIPAdapter class to add to
  the SIP table.
- Added the jade.semantics.interpreter.sips.adapters package, which provides a
  number of useful SIP adapters to customize the behaviour of the developped
  semantic agents:
  * The BeliefTransferSIPAdapter makes it possible to control the transfer of
    belief on any pattern of formula from any pattern of agent (several
    instances may be added into the SIP table for each nedded patterns).
  * The IntentionTransferSIPAdapter makes it possible to control the transfer of
    intention on any pattern of goal from any pattern of agent, as well as the
    feed-back to give to the requesting agent.
  * The PlanningSIPAdapter makes it possible to plug any planning algorithm to
    find a plan (given as a FIPA-SL action expression) to reach a given pattern
    of goal.
  * The ActionDoneSIPAdapter makes it possible to trigger any piece of code upon
    the completion of a given pattern of action by a given pattern of agent
    (including actions from the semantic agent itself).
  * The QueryRefSIPAdapter and the CFPSIPAdapter make it possible to prepare the
    answers to a received QueryRef or CFP. In particular, it is possible to
    delay the answers, so that the semantic agent can perform some processing
    (e.g. querying other agents) before answering.
- Improved the SemanticCapabilities class:
  * The install method can now be applied to any JADE agent. In the same way,
    the SemanticAgent interface becomes a class, deprecating the
    SemanticAgentBase class.
  * Added a return type to the setupXXX methods to better control the install
    operation.
  * Added convenient methods to send FIPA-ACL messages to other agents (one
    method per performative plus the unsubscribe method to cancel a previously
    sent subscribe message).
  * Added several interpret methods to directly invoke the corresponding methods
    of the SemanticInterpreterBehaviour class. A new signature of the method
    makes it possible to interpret a set of formulas from a Java Reader object.
- Simplified writing of FIPA-SL formulas (given as arguments of the
  SemanticCapabilities.interpret, KBase.assert, KBase.query methods, as observed
  formulas of Oberver objects and as formula patterns of SIP objects):
  * The reserved "??myself" meta-reference may be used to refer to the semantic
    agent (instead of "??agent" in some particular cases before the 1.4
    version).
  * Formulas are automatically surrounded with a belief modality. For example,
    asserting "(B ??myself (isBusy john))" may be asserted specifying simply
    "(isBusy john)".
- Improved the handling of some action expressions:
  * Upon completion of some atomic action performance, the corresponding "(done
    ??action)" formula is automatically interpreted and may be further catched
    by an application-specific ActionDoneSIPAdpater. The content of subsequent
    inform-done messages is now the same "(done ??action)" formula instead of
    the less intuitive "(exists ?e (done (; ??action e)))" formula.
  * JSA agents can now perform action expressions including atomic actions from
    other agents. Such actions actually install a one shot SIP, which monitors
    their performance by the other agent (based on the achievement of their
    effect).


OTHER IMPROVEMENTS
- Added some new generic filters for FilterKBase implementations:
  * a set of filters (gathered in the NestedBeliefFilters class) to deal with
    the beliefs on other agents' beliefs.
  * a set of filters (managed by the FunctionalTermTable interface) to store
    functional terms and handle them with virtual predicates.
- Improved the SL handling operations:
  * General improvement of: internal implementation, matching operations,
    cloning of MatchResult objects, isMentalAttitude and isFreeVarialbe methods
    on Formula nodes (better handling of meta-reference arguments)
  * Renamed some operations on SL nodes: ActionExpression.getAgents -> getActors
  * Added some operations on SL nodes: instantiate, isExistsOn (Formula nodes) ;
    instantiate (Term nodes) ; getActor, getFirstStep (ActionExpression nodes) ;
    size, getTerm (TermSet and TermSequence nodes) ; byteValue (Constant
    nodes) ; getLeaves (And and Or nodes) ; intantiate on an array of nodes (SL
    class).
  * Removed the simplification of Any and Some nodes embedded in Equals nodes.
- Extended the FIPA-SL grammar with "and", "or", "|" and ";" operators that
  accept an arbitrary number of arguments (e.g. "(and f1 (and f2 f3))" may be
  written "(and f1 f2 f3)").
- Improved some SIPs
  * Optimized the SplitAndSIP and ActionFeatureSIP classes.
  * Added a "one shot" and a "timeout" mode on the ApplicationSpecificSIPAdapter
    class (to automatically drop a SIP from the SIP table after its application
    or a timeout expiration)
  * Improved the planning-related SIPs (including the PlanningSIPAdapter
    subclasses and IntentionalBehaviour class) by handling only FIPA-SL action
    expressions (instead of JADE behaviours). The FeedBackData field of the
    SemanticRepresentation class has also been replaced by a more general
    Annotation field (implemented by a hash-map).
  * Added a SemanticRepresentation argument to the doApply method of all SIP
    adapters.
- Improved the implementation of semantic actions:
  * CommunicativeActs now assume fipa-sl if no content language is specified.
  * Renamed the reserved meta-reference refering to the actor of an action from
    "??sender" to "??actor" (to conform to FIPA specifications)
  * Replaced the SemanticActionTable arguments of the constructors of all
    SemanticAction subclasses with SemanticCapabilities arguments.
  * Added the RUNNING constant to the SemanticBehaviour interface.
- Added a JSA-based dummy agent. It uses the same package and class name as
those of the JADE framework, so that it can be transparently used in the JADE
RMA GUI by specifying the JSA jar file before the JADE jar file in the
classpath. Very useful for debugging.


BUG FIXES
- Fixed a bug in the matching of FIPA-SL expressions.
- Copied all predefined result SR passed to the doApply methods of the various
  SIP adapters, to fix a bug on the SR indexes when the SIP was not applicable,
- Improved the query filter for And nodes to work symetrically (left and right
  sides can be evaluated in any order),
- Improved the subscription mecanism to take into account all the data attached
  to the subscribed SR,
- Fixed a bug in the getIndex method of the new SIP table implementation,
- Redefined the size method of the new SIP table implementation,
- Fixed the getTriggeredPattern method of the IREFilter class.






MAJOR CHANGES in JSA 1.2 (26 January 2006)
==========================================================================


GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS:
- The current JADE Semantics Add-On works on J2SE, PJAVA, .NET environments.
  A support for the MIDP environment is planned in future versions, in order to
  run Semantic Agents on mobile phones.
  To compile the framework for a given environment, specify the environment
  name in the ant command line (example: ant pjava lib).
- Moreover, the JSA framework can now be compiled from Java SDK 1.4 (and not
  necessarily Java SDK 1.5)
- Fixed bug on OntoActionBehaviour. When an exception was raised during the
  perform method execution of this behaviour, the agent died. Now, the exception
  is catched and the behaviour state is set to execution_failure.
- In the class SemanticInterpreterBehaviour, set the visibility of the
  receiveNextMessage method to public.
- Multiple receivers of received messages taken into account.


INTERPRETER:
- Added a SIP EqualsIRE which manages the equality between an Identify
  Expression and a formula.
- Better architecture between SIPs and KBase assert filters.


SL HANDLING:
- Added a class ListOfMatchResults.
- Added a new referential operator: some (this is an extension to the FIPA-SL
  grammar: (some ?x (p ?X)) returns a set of terms satisfying the p predicate,
  whereas (all ?x (p ?x)) returns the set of exactly all terms satisfying p).
- Revised simplification of B-Forall formulas.
- Byte encoding/decoding correction (added Base64 class).
- Improved the matching function in ordre to match AndNode and OrNode as
  unordered lists of formula (e.g. (or p q) matches (or q p)). This is
  particulary useful when matching a pattern of formula, where the order of non
  instantiated meta-references is not known in advance.
- In the same way, improved the matching function so that the "=" SL predicate
  is considered as commutative (i.e. (= a b) and (= b a) match).
- Added Util class, which contains utility methods.


BELIEF BASE:
- The belief base handles the closure information conveyed by the identifying
  referential expressions "all" and "iota". For example:
  * (iota ?x (p ?x)) refers to the ONLY ?x which makes (p ?x) true.
  * (any ?x (p ?x)) refers to one ?x which makes (p ?x) true.
  After asserting the formula (= (iota ?x (p ?x)) 1), the answer to the query on
  (= (iota ?x (p ?x)) 1) is true, because the belief base has interpreted the
  iota operator as meaning 1 is the only possible value for predicate p.
  However, after asserting simply the formula (p 1), the answer to the query on
  (= (iota ?x (p ?x)) 1) is null, because the belief base has no element to
  consider 1 as the only possible value for p (in this case, a query on (= (any
  ?x (p ?x)) 1) still returns true, of course)
- Automatic handling of "B" operators in the assertFormula and the query methods
  for more convenience (e.g. asserting or querying for "(p 1)" is equivalent to
  asserting or querying "(B agent (p 1)").
- Optimized the query operation: when the belief base is updated, observers are
  called only if they are concerned by this update.
- Forall and Exists operators are taken into account.
- The (not (B agent ??formula)) pattern is taken into account by the
  assertFormula method to remove formulas from the base (this makes the
  removeAllFormulae deprecated).
- Added a retractFormula to the KBase interface. A call to retractFormula with
  the F formula is equivalent to a call to assertFormula with (not (B agent F)).
  This makes the removeFormula deprecated.
- The result to a query is now the list of MatchResult that are solutions to the
  query (added QueryResult class). This makes it possible to query formulas
  including meta-refences (e.g. query on (p ??X) returns the list of all
  bindings for ??X satisfying the predicate p).
- Removed queryRef filters (queryRef filters become query filters using meta-
  references, see the previous point).


PLANNER:
- Modified the planner interface


OTHER:
- The following classes do not exist any more:
  kbase.Bind
  kbase.Bindings
  kbase.BindingsImpl
  kbase.filter.KBQueryRefFilter
- The following package do not exist any more:
  kbase.filter.queryRef

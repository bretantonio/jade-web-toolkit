/**
 * Provides the classes to handle the belief base of JSA agents.
 * 
 * The JSA engine exclusively access the belief base component through the
 * {@link jade.semantics.kbase.KBase} interface, which can therefore be freely
 * implemented by developers.
 * For convenience, the JSA framework provides a default implementation, based
 * on the {@link jade.semantics.kbase.FilterKBase} sub-interface, which has a
 * good tradeoff between expressivity and efficiency.

<p>
The JADE Semantics Add-on is a framework that eases the development of cognitive
agents with automatic understanding capabilities of FIPA-ACL messages. It also
provides developers with a high-level programming style, based on the abstract
concepts of the FIPA-SL logical language (beliefs, intentions, facts expressed
as logical formulas, action expressions, ...).
</p>
<p>
The main entry point to create semantic agents using the JSA framework is the
{@link jade.semantics.interpreter.SemanticCapabilities} class. Instances of this
class may be installed on any JADE agent, however the
{@link jade.semantics.interpreter.SemanticAgent} class provides an basic semantic
agent already equiped with a <code>SemanticCapabilities</code> instance, which
can be easily extended.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the {@link jade.semantics.ext} package provides some useful extensions
of the basic JSA framework. There are currently three open source extensions: the
emotion extension makes it possible to handle an internal emotional state for
JSA-based agents, the sqlwrapper extension makes it possible to connect a JSA
belief base to a SQL database in order to store (or retrieve) some beliefs into
a relational database, and the institutions extension makes it possible to reason
about institutional concepts (obligations, institutional powers...) and exchange
institutional speech acts (declarations, promises).

/**
 * This interface defines belief base API.
 * The belief base is a central component of the JSA framework, which mainly
 * maintains the internal state of semantic agents, in terms of their explicit
 * symbolic representation of their environment. This symbolic representation
 * is expressed by FIPA-SL formulas.
 * <p>
 * This interface provides three main kinds of operations:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>update the semantic agent's internal state, by
 *         {@linkplain #assertFormula(Formula) asserting} or
 *         {@linkplain #retractFormula(Formula) retracting} formulas,</li>
 *     <li>retrieve beliefs from the semantic agent's internal state, by
 *         querying {@linkplain #query(Formula) formulas} or
 *         {@linkplain #queryRef(IdentifyingExpression) IREs} (Identifying
 *         Referential Expressions),</li>
 *     <li>notify changes of the semantic agent's internal state, by
 *         {@linkplain #addObserver(Observer) installing} or
 *         {@linkplain #removeObserver(Observer) uninstalling} observers.</li> 
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * The {@link KBase} interface was primarily intended to be implemented by third
 * parties. However, as it is quite a difficult and very technical task, the
 * JSA frameworks provides a default {@linkplain jade.semantics.kbase.FilterKBase
 * filter-based implementation}, which offers a good trade-off between efficiency
 * and expressiveness.

     * Assert a fact (given as a FIPA-SL formula) believed by the owning agent
     * into this belief base. It is very important to understand that asserted
     * facts are necessarily facts <b>believed</b> by the agent, independently
     * from their truth value in the real world.
     * <p>
     * Asserting <code>p</code> actually means that <code>(B ??myself p)</code>
     * is true (where <code>??myself</code> represents the agent owning the belief
     * base), while asserting <code>(not p)</code> actually means that
     * <code>(B ??myself (not p))</code> is true.
     * <br>
     * Consequently, asserting <code>p</code> is equivalent to asserting
     * <code>(B ??myself p)</code> (because in the underlying formal model -
     * see the <a href="http://www.fipa.org/specs/fipa00008">FIPA SL specifications</a>,
     * <code>(B i (B i p))</code> is logically equivalent to <code>(B i p)</code>).
     * </br>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The {@link KBase} implementations are expected to maintain a logically
     * consistent set of beliefs. When a fact, which is inconsistent with an
     * already stored belief, is asserted, the implementation must explicitly
     * choose an option that ensures the global consistency (for example, keeping
     * the most recently asserted fact in the base).
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Depending on their sophistication, the {@link KBase} implementations may
     * not be able to actually store all asserted facts. In this case, the reasoning
     * (or "intellectual") capabilities of the owning agent will simply be
     * considered as limited, which is a very common case. In any case, the
     * asserted facts that cannot be dealt with should not create any inconsistency
     * in the belief base. For example, the implementation provided with the
     * JSA framework does not deal with uncertainty modal operators, so that
     * asserting <code>(U ??myself p)</code> has no effect.
